## Overview

I have been watching the NBA for many years now, and I also collect some basketball cards. I wanted to take a deeper dive into their game statistics and hopefully to find out more about the player and possible trends and play styles. This analysis will look at their recent 50 games.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from https://sportsdata.io/developers/api-documentation/nba#/sports-data-feeds
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
